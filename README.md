# Ruby Linter

This is a [linter](https://sourcelevel.io/blog/what-is-a-linter-and-why-your-team-should-use-it) developed in Ruby for Ruby (.rb) files. It's a linter for beginners, it provides feedback about errors or warning in code line by line by :
- flagging bugs in your code from some syntax errors
- giving you warnings when code is not correct
- heplping you to keep a consistent code style

## Examples

> Limit lines to 40 characters.
```
# bad
puts 'lorem pesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing'

# good
puts 'lorem pesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was '
puts 'popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets'
puts 'Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing'

```

> Avoid single-line methods.
```
# bad
def too_much; something; something_else; end

# okish - notice that the first ; is required
def no_braces_method; body end

# okish - notice that the second ; is optional
def no_braces_method; body; end

# okish - valid syntax, but no ; makes it kind of hard to read
def some_method() body end

# good
def some_method
  body
end

```

> No spaces after (, [ or before ], ). Use spaces around { and before }.
```
# bad
some( arg ).other
[ 1, 2, 3 ].each{|e| puts e}

# good
some(arg).other
[1, 2, 3].each { |e| puts e }

```

> Use CamelCase for classes and modules.
```
# bad
class Someclass
  # some code
end

class Some_Class
  # some code
end

class SomeXml
  # some code
end

class XmlSomething
  # some code
end

# good
class SomeClass
  # some code
end

class SomeXML
  # some code
end

class XMLSomething
  # some code
end

```

> Use spaces around operators, after commas, colons and semicolons.
```
# bad
sum=1+2
a,b=1,2

# good
sum = 1 + 2
a, b = 1, 2

```
